# Q1. Name few data types of python?
# A1. int, float, string, bool, complex, list, tuple, set, dict, None

# Q2. What is the difference between list and tuples in Python?
# A2. List: mutable, slower than tuple
#     Tuple: immutable, faster than list

# Q3. How to find type of data?
# A3. type() function is used to find the data type

# Q4. What kind of error is type error?
# A4. It is a run time error

# Q5. how to remove duplicate items of list?  
# A5. convert list to set and again to list.

# Q6. which operator is used for increment?
# A6. "+=", ++ operator is not defined in python

# Q7. what does "%" operator returns?
# A7. It returns remainder of division.

# Q8. What is the output of the following code : print 9//2?
# A8. 4

# Q9. What is the output of the following code : print 9/2?
# A9. 4.5

# Q10. What is the output of the following code : print 2**3?
# A10. 8

# Q11. What is pass in Python?
# A11. Pass means, no-operation Python statement, or in other words it is a place holder in compound statement, 
#      where there should be a blank left and nothing has to be written there.

# Q12. What Is The Difference Between Pass And Continue In Python? 
# A12. The continue statement makes the loop to resume from the next iteration.
#      On the contrary, the pass statement instructs to do nothing, and the remainder of the code executes as usual.

# Q13. What Is A Built-In Function That Python Uses To Iterate Over A Number Sequence?
# A13. Range() generates a list of numbers, which is used to iterate over for loops.

# Q14. What is the output of : lst = [x for x in range(1,11)]
# A14. lst = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

# Q15. What is lambda in Python?
# A15. anonymous function means that a function is without a name. As we already know that def keyword is used 
#      to define the normal functions and the lambda keyword is used to create anonymous functions.

# Q16. Mention the use of the split function in Python?
# A16. The use of the split function in Python is that it breaks a string into shorter strings using the 
#      defined separator. It gives a list of all words present in the string.

# Q17. Is It Mandatory For A Python Function To Return A Value? 
# A17. It is not at all necessary for a function to return any value. However, if needed, we can use None 
#      as a return value.

# Q18. What is *args and **kwargs?
# A18. *args is used when the programmer is not sure about how many arguments are going to be passed to a 
#      function, or if the programmer is expecting a list or a tuple as argument to the function.
#     **kwargs is used when a dictionary (keyword arguments) is expected as an argument to the function.

# Q19. What is a Counter in Python? 
# A19. The function Counter() from the module ‘collections’. It counts the number of occurrences of the elements 
#      of a container.

# Q20. When do you choose a list over a tuple?
# A20. When there is an immutable ordered list of elements we choose tuple. Because we cannot add/remove an 
#      element from the tuple. On the other hand, we can add elements to a list using append () or extend() or insert(),
#      etc., and delete elements from a list using remove() or pop().
